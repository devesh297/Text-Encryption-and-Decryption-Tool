I developed a text encryption and decryption tool using Python's tkinter library, enabling users to securely encrypt and decrypt text messages with password protection. Leveraging base64 encoding for encryption and decryption alongside password authentication, the application ensures data security. With error handling functionalities implemented for incorrect passwords and empty input fields, the tool provides a user-friendly experience. By incorporating image handling with PIL and tkinter's messagebox for error messages, I successfully created an intuitive graphical interface, demonstrating proficiency in Python, GUI development, and encryption techniques.
